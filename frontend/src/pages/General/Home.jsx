                  Fatima Mohsin Naqvi is an internationally qualified
                  psychotherapist with a Master's degree in Counseling for
                  Mental Health and Wellness from NYU. After graduating, she
                  worked in New York and California across various settings,
                  including private practices, hospitals, schools, and mental
                  health organizations. Her sub-specialty is working with
                  adolescents and young adults. In California, Fatima received
                  training in suicide and crisis assessments, coordinating care
                  with police and mental health professionals to provide
                  emergency support. She is also trained in operating the 988
                  suicide hotline.

                  Fatima is passionate about relational work and takes a
                  person-centered approach in therapy. While she has experience
                  in CBT and psychodynamic modalities, she collaborates with
                  each client to find the approach that works best for them.
                  Over the years, she has developed a practice rooted in the
                  belief that therapy is most effective when it is collaborative
                  rather than instructive.
